# Fork of YouTube Download (youtube-dl) written in Python. 

I learned about it from a [gist](https://gist.github.com/pauloxnet/0fa24efcca6946550eeee2133aa3fbd0) that Paulo Melichore. 

I'm using it to download the views for DjangoCon US views from YouTube and putting it into a datasette instance [here](https://dcus-views.ryancheley.com/views/views)

This process will capture the view count at a specific time each day and allow me to track the views on my video in particular.
