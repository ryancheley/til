# Run remote scripts with uv

While talking to Jeff during our writing session today he mentioned that you can run remote single-file Python Scripts with uv. He pointed me to this [post](https://joshcannon.me/2025/04/24/remote-single-file-scripts.html) for details on how it would be done and I was ðŸ¤¯

I won't repeat what the article says, but I'm thinking about how this can be applied at work for some of the SSIS ETL packages that use Python. The current set up is ... challenging to implement. So much so that essentially I'm the only one that's done it and I loathe the next time I have to do it because it's not easy to do ( even with good docs!)

I'm really looking forward to how I might be able to implement this at work ... but it will involve getting uv installed on a server, and that is a challenge in and of itself.
