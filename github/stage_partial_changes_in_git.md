# Stage Partial Changes in Git

Today I learned about the use of the p flag on `git add`, i.e. `git add -p` which will allow you to interactively add files to a commit, i.e. stage partial changes. 

Mind. Blown.

This tip came from a video posted by [PyBites](https://pybit.es) on their [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/PyBites)

You can see the specific use of `-p` at the 9:42 of the video [PyBites Git Tricks Training](https://youtu.be/7ZQ9q7Cd9b0?t=582)
