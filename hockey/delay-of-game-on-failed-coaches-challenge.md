# Delay of Game on Failed Coaches Challenge

While watching the [Colorado Avalanche](https://www.nhl.com/avalanche/) play the [Ottawa Senators](https://www.nhl.com/senators/) in Colorado [tonight](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/col-vs-ott/2023/12/21/2023020507) a Power Play Goal had been scored giving [Nathan MacKinnon](https://www.nhl.com/avalanche/player/nathan-mackinnon-8477492) his third goal of the game (a [Hat Trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick))

The Ottawa coach challenged the validity of the goal indicating there was an offside on the play and negating the goal. The refs reviewed it for a long time and then declared that the goal was good and the challenge failed. 

This lead to a Delay of Game penalty on Ottawa for a failed coaches challenge.
