While watching [a video on YouTube](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiu4OSS1PmEAxWck4kEHedYCXoQwqsBegQICBAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DU2uwdVSfaDo&usg=AOvVaw0xGYxzDUlv6v82tY7FAAuW&opi=89978449) the other day I learned that 

> NHL rules stipulate that a team that pulls the goalie for an extra attacker and winds up losing on an empty-net goal forfeits the point they get for simply getting to overtime. 

When two teams make it to Overtime they are, generally, guaranteed to get at least 1 point. The "generally" here is something that I didn't know because the circusmstanes where a team wouldn't be guaranteed the point have only happened a few times in ALL of NHL history, most recently on March 9th, 2024. 

The niche rules in hockey, specifically the NHL, continues to fascinate me!
