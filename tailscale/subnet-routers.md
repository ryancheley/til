# Subnet Routers

Subnet routers (previously called a relay node or relaynode) on Tailscale allow you to access devices or computers that can't have tailscale installed on them. This is helpful for printers and other IoT devices. 

From the [docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets)

> However, in some situations, you can’t or don’t want to install Tailscale on each device:
> 
> - With embedded devices, like printers, which don’t run external software
> - When connecting large quantities of devices, [like an entire AWS VPC](https://tailscale.com/kb/1021/install-aws)
> - When incrementally deploying Tailscale (eg. on legacy networks)
